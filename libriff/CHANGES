Since 1.06 :

- WARNING: changed the API. _RFRraw_seek() now calls 
  _RFRget_next_info() to read block information whenever
  you seek. I decided that it was a little bit redundant
  to use _RFRraw_seek() as a simple wrapper (why use
  _RFRraw_seek, instead of fseek()?) so I added a  
  call to _RFRget_next_info(). DO NOT CALL THIS FUNCTION
  after _RFRraw_seek().

- Some changes to the manual.
