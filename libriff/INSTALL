Currently the default Makefile should work with "make" (also "make clean")
on unix environments. The Windows32 makefile for the mingw environment, by
Simon Moser, is also available under the name Makefile.w32. Rename it
to "Makefile" and you should be able to build libriff under the mingw
suite of GCC tools.

Note that I have never used the "make install" option. It may be broken. Anyway, 
if you use libriff for developement you should be able to do that manually,
_IF_ you need a SYSTEM-WIDE installation :

(as root or user with appropriate permissions)

a) Copy libriff.a and libriff-##.so to /usr/local/lib or any path in the
   ld.so.conf file

b) Copy all header files to /usr/local/include or (preferrably) in	
   /usr/local/include/riff where they should be accessible as 
   #include <riff/riffwrite.h> etc. (#include <riffread.h> if
   you use the /usr/local/include or /usr/include) 

c) Run ldconfig

NOTE: You do not need a system-wide install of libriff for developement. 
Just keep a visible copy of librff.a/so and header files in your source
tree.

I will write a "make install" once libriff has stabilized fully.
