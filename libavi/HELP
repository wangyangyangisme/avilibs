I'm having trouble timing audio streams. I cannot understand how it 
works, especially in VBR streams. 

Video frames are quite simple: if we have 25 fps, 1 frame is 0.04 sec.

How does that work for audio frames? I understand that for
PCM (e.g) 44100 16bit samples are 1 second but what happens
with MP3, or OGG, or ADPCM? 

If someone can explain this and/or point me to some authoritative resource
I would greatly appreciate it. 

Note that the library works OK without this, but I think it would be nice
to have correct timing (especially in order to deal with synchronization issues).
