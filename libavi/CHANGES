Note that avilibs uses a seperate version
number than libavi, because avilibs is 
a *bundle* of libraries that will include
more software in the future (I hope).


Since 0.68 :

- API change : added _AVRinit_stream_position()
  that tries to find the first frame from every
  stream. This means that every stream is positioned
  at its first frame (both in the file and in the
  index - if available) and not at the beggining
  of the movi list. This is in effect a "rewind"
  for all streams. Note that even if this function
  fails (which it should not!) you can still use
  the seeking functions. You should call 
  _AVRinit_stream_position() after AVRbuild_idx()
  if you build an index from scratch to update
  the index pointers. (this is not mandatory).

  You may use _AVRinit_stream_position() as a
  global "rewind".

- API change :  added AVRget_frame_idx, that
  works with the index (syncs the file to the
  index before reading) AVRget_frame_idx does 
  move the file pointer but it does NOT move 
  the index pointers. This function interoperates
  nicely with the other *_idx functions.

- The function AVRget_frame() may not interoperate
  well with the *_idx functions. I have not tested
  it heavily yet, because reading WITHOUT an index
  is currently not my first priority.

- API change : AVRprevious_frame_idx and AVRnext_frame_idx()
  now work "properly", in the sense that they 
  a) Move the file to the next/previous valid frame
  b) Move the index to the next/previous valid position
  The previous behaviour used to be:
  a) Move the file to the next/previous valid frame	
  b) Move the index after/before the next/previous valid position
  To better understand this (if it isn't completely obvious)
  see the code in the test/ directory.
  Also they should be more robust and stable.

- Corrected a bug in AVRprevious_frame_idx() that
  resulted in an index pointer <0. 

- Added some more test code to verify that AVRget_frame_idx()
  works properly.

- Made some minor changes to ensure compatibility
  with libriff-1.08 (_RFRraw_seek() has changed).

- Made minor changes to the tutorial and example code.
