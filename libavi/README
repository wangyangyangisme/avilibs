This code is in ALPHA status. It is 
intended for people that are reasonably
experienced with compilers, debuggers etc.
It does provide some functionality but
is far from being complete (NOTE: libavi
will never DECODE video streams! it just handles
file creation/parsing/demultiplexing and eventually
synchronization). To compile you need the current
libriff, please have a look at the makefile, it's quite 
readable.

It is not my intention to contribute to
the huge load of bad code that circulates on
the internet. This code is currently
being developed and is therefore NOT FINAL.
Please bear with me. Such things do take time.

All bug reports are extremely welcome. 
If you feel you can add something to the code
please contact me at <ptsant at otenet.gr>.

Documentation is being slowly written. Until then have a
look at the test directory for some minor 
examples. The /doc directory contains the manual (under
heavy developement!) and some examples. Do not take them
too seriously, they are not yet ready.

Have fun!
