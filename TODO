In order of priority:


- Finish AVRstream_support.c functions and freeze the 
  interface once I have verified that it is functional.

- Start adding stream support for avi writing (AVW)

- Debug libavi thoroughly

- Write the documentation

- Design libcodec for unified and automatic handling
  of video/audio codecs. (DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH)

- etc...
